#Indie Dev Club Organizational Charter

##Statement of Purpose

Digital game creation is an ascendent artistic medium that has the ability to provide unique social and aesthetic experiences. As means of creation and modes of distribution become more democratized, the potential for individuals to create experiences and tell stories is becoming more and more accessible: anyone who wants to make a game can.

The mental and technical barriers to doing so, however, are often intimidating. The tools out there are not quite fully there and can be intimidating to beginners. The dominant narratives of video game creation tend to build walls around the sorts of people and the sort of pathways one can take to become a game creator: either start out toiling away in QA, or be a superhuman self-motivator willing to spend 3-5 years working in obscurity before making a big hit.

We seek to help tear down these walls.

We seek to be an explicitly inclusive and accessible group of collaborators from all backgrounds and skill-levels, who come together to empower ourselves with the ability to create games. As a grassroots organization, we seek to give power to alternative voices, and help artists and creators develop connections, learn from each other, provide accountability and feedback, and help each other become the best creators we can be.

##Organizational Goals

The primary goals of the organization will be:

To provide an inclusive and welcoming space to play games and meet other people interested in games and their production who share these values.

To help connect storytellers to the capacity to tell their stories.

To celebrate difference and to encourage and foster underrepresented voices in the game space. 

To be useful for creators on all parts of the gaming lifecycle or spectrum, from newcomers to established or experienced.

To connect game creators and artists with each other, through events and online communication.

To provide resources and tools to encourage the building of the skills needed for game creation.

To provide a forum for informed critical feedback on our work in a safe space. Create a space where you can safely declare yourself and ask questions.

To provide an environment that encourages the “Growth Mindset,” to embrace that our abilities and skills are not fixed traits, to encourage challenges, to be persistent in the face of setbacks, to learn from criticism, and to find lessons and inspiration from the works and stories of others.

## Organization Activities

The primary activity of the group will be to gather together for a variety of in-person events that arise from the interests of the members. The current main focus of events are:

* Social / Fun / Networking Meetups. Examples: Casually playing games together, Game-playing tournaments, Board-game nights.
* Talks or seminars. Examples: Lightning Talks, longer-form deep-dives on particular subject areas, educational seminars put on by members or outside experts.
* Show and Tell. Members presenting their work and soliciting feedback. Ex.: Game Presentation nights, Demo Nights
* Discussion Meetups. Examples: book clubs, critical game analysis discussions, current trends/affairs discussions.
* Game Jams: Events whose goal is to bring people together to create full games in a short period of time. Example: Lightning Jams, Rapid Prototyping, “Iron Chef”-style events, getting together to participate in external jams such as Ludem Dare
* Hack Days/Nights: Events whose goals are for people to gather and work on independent and collaborative projects. 
* Un-Conferences: Group gets together, selects topics they want to discuss, vote on what people are interested in, then break into groups to talk about them

Individuals will be empowered and provided resources and help to put on events. While events may be organized and run by a group, event should have a single “owner” who takes it upon themselves to be responsible for the success of the event.

The group will try to strike a balance between events that have mass appeal, and events that dig deeper into the substance of different areas of the video game discipline. All members are welcome to all events, but in order to provide depth of experience, it is expected that not all members will be interested in all events. We will strive to be explicit about expectations for what will take place at certain events and what level of background knowledge would allow an event to be most effective for participants.

The group will encourage and foster the creation and collaboration of smaller groups who want to meet to discuss particular special interest areas. 

Consistent and regular events will be encouraged, to keep momentum and to keep the group alive.

## Organizational Structure

The organization strives to be as open and democratic as possible, to be for and by the members. To this end, we seek to have well-defined and transparent, yet malleable organizational structure.

Group events will be planned and orchestrated by an open planning committee. Anyone who is willing to spend the time and effort planning and helping put on events is welcome on the committee. Day-to-day event-planning and brainstorming activities of the committee will happen over a dedicated email list, currently: indiedevclub-action@googlegroups.com. Regular quarterly in-person meetings of the planning committee will take place to brainstorm new events, and provide mechanism for group reform as described below.

The technical permissions to announce and promote events through the group’s main communication channels will be limited to a small number of organizers elected from the planning committee. In the group’s current nascent state, there is not much controversy about this; should controversy arise in the future, the planning committee will democratically determine how to proceed.

At any given time, it is advised that there will be at least one self-appointed “prime instigator,” whose role is to ensure regular meetings take place, and to help work to ensure the success of the group’s events. Should the group find difficulty finding any one individual interested enough in the organization to play this role, a meeting should take place to review the organizational tenets and determine how the group needs to change to get members excited enough to want to work to ensure the success of the group.

It is inevitable that things will go wrong and missteps will be made -- we will inadvertently do things counter-productive to our mission. In order to counteract this, we will provide feedback mechanisms to critique and iterate on the group’s structure and practices to allow ourselves to correct problems with the group. This will be addressed in the regular planning committee meetings, through the form of a periodic group review of the charter, and post-mortem of what succeeded and failed at recent events.

## Finances

Maintaining a meetup group on meetup.com and running events cost money -- this is at odds with the desire to to provide a space where anyone can attend an event without having to pay. For now, meetup.com dues will be fronted by whoever is the official “organizer” on the meetup.

The initial plans for offsetting relying entirely on the generosity of organizers are to:

* Solicit anonymous donations at events
* Solicit sponsorships from organizations or venues that agree with and support our values

If this does not adequately offset costs, other means will be brainstormed and implemented.

# Harassment Policy

In order to maintain the group’s culture of openness and inclusiveness, there will be no tolerance in the group for:

* Insults and Harassment
* Fraudulent or Illegal behavior
